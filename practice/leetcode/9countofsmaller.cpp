Give you an integer array (index from 0 to n-1, where n is the size of this array, value from 0 to 10000) .
For each element Ai in the array, count the number of element before this element Ai is smaller than it and return count number array.

 Notice

We suggest you finish problem Segment Tree Build, Segment Tree Query II and Count of Smaller Number before itself I first.

Example
For array [1,2,7,8,5], return [0,1,2,3,2]
